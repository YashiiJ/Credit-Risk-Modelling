# Credit-Risk-Modelling

Credit risk refers to the likelihood of a borrower failing to repay a loan, leading to potential financial losses for the lender. When financial institutions extend services like mortgages, credit cards, or personal loans, there exists an inherent risk that the borrower may default on their repayment obligations. To evaluate this risk, factors like credit history, repayment capacity, loan terms, and annual income can be considered.

Many companies, especially financial institutions, evaluate the credit risk of their existing and forthcoming customers. With the advent of technologies like machine learning, organizations can analyze customer data to establish a risk profile. Credit risk modeling evaluates a borrower's credit risk based primarily on two factors. The first factor is determining the probability of a borrower defaulting on a loan, while the second factor involves evaluating the financial impact on the lender in case of such a default.

Applying machine learning to credit risk modeling can significantly enhance an organization's ability to make informed lending decisions while efficiently managing risk. As financial institutions seek to improve lending practices and risk management, machine learning continues to play a pivotal role in shaping the future of credit risk assessment.

In this data analysis project, the goal is to explore the feasibility of using machine learning algorithms such as Random Forests and XGBoost to model and assess risks within a dataset available on Kaggle. The primary objective is to investigate whether these algorithms can effectively analyze the data and provide insights into various types of risks.
